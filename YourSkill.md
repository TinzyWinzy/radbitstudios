# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly before implementing. Ask if uncertain.
- Present multiple interpretations instead of picking silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First
- Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If >200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"

## 3. Surgical Changes
- Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports/variables/functions YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Define success criteria before starting. Loop until verified.
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with verification checks.
